# DBSCAN_IRIS_DATASET
 This is the source code that I used to perform Density Based Clustering on Iris dataset
Density based clustering has 2 main important Points.
1. THe EPS which tells how much the distance should be between two points to coin them neighbours.
2. The second one is min_pts or minimimum number of points a core point should have to from a cluster.

A core point is a random point which meets the 2 criteria of eps and min_pts.
THe points which do no belong to any cluster and have no neighbours are called as outliers or noise.
